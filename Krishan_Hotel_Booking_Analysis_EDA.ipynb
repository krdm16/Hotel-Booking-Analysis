        "The hotel booking dataset provided is a valuable resource for exploring various factors that influence hotel bookings and analysing patterns in the data. The dataset includes information on bookings made at a city hotel and a resort hotel, offering insights into when bookings are made, the length of stay, the number of guests (adults, children, and babies), and the availability of parking spaces, among other details. It is important to note that all personally identifying information has been removed from the dataset to ensure privacy. By delving into this dataset, we can uncover significant factors that\n",
        "govern hotel bookings. One area of interest could be identifying the best time of year to book a hotel room. By analyzing the booking timestamps and correlating them with the corresponding rates, patterns may emerge to reveal the optimal booking time for securing the most favorable prices.\n",
        "Another aspect to explore within the dataset is the relationship between the length of stay and the daily rate. By examining the data, one can assess whether longer stays are associated with discounted rates or if there are specific durations that offer better value for guests. This information can help individuals plan their trips more effectively and potentially save money on their hotel accommodations.\n",
        "This hotel booking project focuses on two types of hotels: City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The dataset contains 119,390 rows and 32 columns. The data manipulation workflow is divided into three categories: data collection, data cleaning and manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the data collection phase, various methods such as Head(), Tail(), Info(), Describe(), and Columns() are used to gather information about the dataset. Important columns like hotel, is_canceled, lead_time, arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, and others are identified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, unique values for each column are examined and a tabular list is generated. Inaccurate data types are corrected during the data cleaning process. Duplicate data items, totaling 87,396, are identified and removed from the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before visualizing the data, data wrangling is performed. Null values in the columns are checked, and columns with a high number of null values are dropped using the 'drop' method. For columns with a minimal number of null values, the missing values are filled as necessary using the .fillna() method.\n",
